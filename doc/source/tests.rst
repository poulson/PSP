Test drivers
============

UnitCube
--------
This section describes the driver 
`tests/UnitCube.cpp <https://github.com/poulson/PSP/blob/master/tests/UnitCube.cpp>`__, which is designed for quickly testing the performance of the sweeping 
preconditioner on a variety of different velocity models.

**TODO**

Interpolate
-----------
The `tests/Interpolate.cpp driver <https://github.com/poulson/PSP/blob/master/tests/Interpolate.cpp>`__ 
is meant to exercise the routine 
:cpp:func:`DistUniformGrid\<F>::InterpolateTo`, which provides a means of 
linearly interpolating a velocity model into a different grid size in parallel.

**TODO**
