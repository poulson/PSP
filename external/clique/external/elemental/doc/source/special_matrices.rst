Special matrices
****************

It is frequently useful to test algorithms on well-known, trivial, and random 
matrices, such as::

1. matrices sampled from uniform distributions over the unit ball,
2. the Wilkinson matrix,
3. and the identity matrix.

Elemental therefore provides utilities for generating many such matrices.
