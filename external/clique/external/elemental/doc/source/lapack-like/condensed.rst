Reduction to condensed form
===========================

Hermitian to tridiagonal
------------------------
The currently best-known algorithms for computing eigenpairs of dense Hermitian 
matrices begin by performing a unitary similarity transformation which reduces 
the matrix to real symmetric tridiagonal form (usually through Householder 
transformations). This routine performs said reduction on a Hermitian matrix 
and stores the scaled Householder vectors in place of the introduced zeroes. 

.. cpp:function:: void HermitianTridiag( UpperOrLower uplo, Matrix<R>& A )

   Overwrites the main and sub (super) diagonal of the real matrix 
   `A` with its similar symmetric tridiagonal matrix and stores the scaled 
   Householder vectors below (above) its tridiagonal entries.

.. cpp:function:: void HermitianTridiag( UpperOrLower uplo, Matrix<Complex<R> >& A, Matrix<Complex<R> >& t )

   Similar to above, but the complex Hermitian matrix is reduced to 
   real symmetric tridiagonal form, with the added complication of needing to 
   also store the phase information for the Householder vectors (the scaling can 
   be inferred since the Householder vectors must be unit length); the scales
   with proper phases are returned in the column vector `t`.

.. cpp:function:: void HermitianTridiag( UpperOrLower uplo, DistMatrix<R>& A )

   Overwrites the main and sub (super) diagonal of the real distributed matrix 
   `A` with its similar symmetric tridiagonal matrix and stores the scaled 
   Householder vectors below (above) its tridiagonal entries.

.. cpp:function:: void HermitianTridiag( UpperOrLower uplo, DistMatrix<Complex<R> >& A, DistMatrix<Complex<R>,STAR,STAR>& t )

   Similar to above, but the complex Hermitian matrix is reduced to 
   real symmetric tridiagonal form, with the added complication of needing to 
   also store the phase information for the Householder vectors (the scaling can 
   be inferred since the Householder vectors must be unit length); the scales
   with proper phases are returned in the column vector `t`.

Please see the *Tuning parameters* section for extensive information on 
maximizing the performance of Householder tridiagonalization.

General to Hessenberg
---------------------
Not yet written, but it is planned and relatively straightforward after 
writing the reductions to tridiagonal and bidiagonal form.

General to bidiagonal
---------------------
Reduces a general fully-populated :math:`m \times n` matrix to bidiagonal form 
through two-sided Householder transformations; when the :math:`m \ge n`, the 
result is upper bidiagonal, otherwise it is lower bidiagonal. This routine is 
most commonly used as a preprocessing step in computing the SVD of a general
matrix.

.. cpp:function:: void Bidiag( Matrix<R>& A )

   Overwrites the main and sub (or super) diagonal of the real matrix `A` with 
   the resulting bidiagonal matrix and stores the scaled Householder vectors in 
   the remainder of the matrix.

.. cpp:function:: void Bidiag( Matrix<Complex<R> >& A, Matrix<Complex<R> >& tP, Matrix<Complex<R> >& tQ )

   Same as above, but the complex scalings for the Householder reflectors are 
   returned in the vectors `tP` and `tQ`.

.. cpp:function:: void Bidiag( DistMatrix<R>& A )

   Overwrites the main and sub (or super) diagonal of the real distributed 
   matrix `A` with the resulting bidiagonal matrix and stores the scaled 
   Householder vectors in the remainder of the matrix.

   .. note:: The :math:`m < n` case is not yet supported.

.. cpp:function:: void Bidiag( DistMatrix<Complex<R> >& A, DistMatrix<Complex<R>,STAR,STAR>& tP, DistMatrix<Complex<R>,STAR,STAR>& tQ )

   Same as above, but the complex scalings for the Householder reflectors are 
   returned in the vectors `tP` and `tQ`.

   .. note:: The :math:`m < n` case is not yet supported.
