The Axpy interface
==================
The Axpy interface is Elemental's version of the PLAPACK Axpy interface, where 
*Axpy*  is derived from the BLAS shorthand for :math:`Y := \alpha X + Y` 
(Alpha X Plus Y). Rather than always requiring users to manually fill their 
distributed matrix, this interface provides a mechanism so that individual processes
can independently submit local submatrices which will be automatically redistributed 
and added onto the global distributed matrix 
(this would be ``LOCAL_TO_GLOBAL`` mode). The interface also allows for the reverse: 
each process may asynchronously request arbitrary subset of the global distributed 
matrix (``GLOBAL_TO_LOCAL`` mode).

.. note:: 
   
   The catch is that, in order for this behavior to be possible, all of the 
   processes that share a particular distributed matrix must synchronize at the 
   beginning and end of the Axpy interface usage (these synchronizations correspond 
   to the ``Attach`` and ``Detach`` member functions). The distributed matrix 
   should **not** be manually modified between the ``Attach`` and ``Detach`` calls.

An example usage might be:

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include "elemental.hpp"
   using namespace elem;
   ...
   // Create an 8 x 8 distributed matrix over the given grid
   DistMatrix<double,MC,MR> A( 8, 8, grid );

   // Set every entry of A to zero
   A.SetToZero();

   // Print the original A
   A.Print("Original distributed A");

   // Open up a LOCAL_TO_GLOBAL interface to A 
   AxpyInterface<double> interface;
   interface.Attach( LOCAL_TO_GLOBAL, A );

   // If we are process 0, then create a 3 x 3 identity matrix, B,
   // and Axpy it into the bottom-right of A (using alpha=2)
   // NOTE: The bottom-right 3 x 3 submatrix starts at the (5,5) 
   //       entry of A.
   // NOTE: Every process is free to Axpy as many submatrices as they 
   //       desire at this point.
   if( grid.VCRank() == 0 )
   {
       Matrix<double> B( 3, 3 );
       B.SetToIdentity();
       interface.Axpy( 2.0, B, 5, 5 );
   }

   // Have all processes collectively detach from A
   interface.Detach();

   // Print the updated A
   A.Print("Updated distributed A");

   // Reattach to A, but in the GLOBAL_TO_LOCAL direction
   interface.Attach( GLOBAL_TO_LOCAL, A );

   // Have process 0 request a copy of the entire distributed matrix
   //
   // NOTE: Every process is free to Axpy as many submatrices as they 
   //       desire at this point.
   Matrix<double> C;
   if( grid.VCRank() == 0 )
   {
       C.ResizeTo( 8, 8 );
       C.SetToZero();
       interface.Axpy( 1.0, C, 0, 0 );
   }

   // Collectively detach in order to finish filling process 0's request
   interface.Detach();
   
   // Process 0 can now locally print its copy of A
   if( g.VCRank() == 0 )
       C.Print("Process 0's local copy of A");

The output would be ::

    Original distributed A
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

    Updated distributed A
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

    0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2

.. cpp:type:: AxpyType

   An enum that can take on the value of either 
   ``LOCAL_TO_GLOBAL`` or ``GLOBAL_TO_LOCAL``, with the meanings described above.

.. cpp:class:: AxpyInterface<T>

   .. cpp:function:: AxpyInterface()

      Initialize a blank instance of the interface class. It will need to later be 
      attached to a distributed matrix before any Axpy's can occur.

   .. cpp:function:: AxpyInterface( AxpyType type, DistMatrix<T,MC,MR>& Z )

      Initialize an interface to the distributed matrix ``Z``, where ``type`` 
      can be either ``LOCAL_TO_GLOBAL`` or ``GLOBAL_TO_LOCAL``.

   .. cpp:function:: AxpyInterface( AxpyType type, const DistMatrix<T,MC,MR>& Z )

      Initialize an interface to the (unmodifiable) distributed matrix ``Z``; 
      since ``Z`` cannot be modified, the only sensical ``AxpyType`` is 
      ``GLOBAL_TO_LOCAL``. The ``AxpyType`` argument was kept in order to be 
      consistent with the previous routine.

   .. cpp:function:: void Attach( AxpyType type, DistMatrix<T,MC,MR>& Z )

      Attach to the distributed matrix ``Z``, where ``type`` can be either 
      ``LOCAL_TO_GLOBAL`` or ``GLOBAL_TO_LOCAL``.

   .. cpp:function:: void Attach( AxpyType type, const DistMatrix<T,MC,MR>& Z )

      Attach to the (unmodifiable) distributed matrix ``Z``; as mentioned above, 
      the only sensical value of ``type`` is ``GLOBAL_TO_LOCAL``, but the
      ``AxpyType`` argument was kept for consistency.

   .. cpp:function:: void Axpy( T alpha, Matrix<T>& Z, int i, int j )

      If the interface was previously attached in the ``LOCAL_TO_GLOBAL`` 
      direction, then the matrix ``\alpha Z`` will be added onto the associated
      distributed matrix starting at the :math:`(i,j)` global index; otherwise 
      :math:`\alpha` times the submatrix of the associated distributed matrix,
      which starts at index :math:`(i,j)` and is of the same size as ``Z``, will 
      be added onto ``Z``.

   .. cpp:function:: void Axpy( T alpha, const Matrix<T>& Z, int i, int j )

      Same as above, but since ``Z`` is unmodifiable, the attachment must have 
      been in the ``LOCAL_TO_GLOBAL`` direction.

   .. cpp:function:: void Detach()

      All processes collectively finish handling each others requests and then 
      detach from the associated distributed matrix.
