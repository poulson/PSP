Eigensolvers and SVD
====================

Hermitian eigensolver
---------------------
**TODO:** Describe :math:`Ax=\lambda x` and ``advanced::HermitianEig`` here.

**TODO:** Describe ``advanced::SortEig`` here.

Skew-Hermitian eigensolver
--------------------------
**TODO:** Describe :math:`Gx=\lambda x` and ``advanced::SkewHermitianEig`` here.

Hermitian generalized-definite eigensolvers
-------------------------------------------
**TODO:** Describe :math:`ABx=\lambda x`, :math:`BAx=\lambda x`, and 
:math:`Ax=\lambda Bx` cases and ``advanced::HermitianGenDefiniteEig``.

Unitary eigensolver
-------------------
Not yet written.

Normal eigensolver
------------------
Not yet written and probably not in the near future.

General eigensolver
-------------------
Not yet written and probably not in the near future.

Schur decomposition
-------------------
Not yet written and probably not in the near future.

Hermitian SVD
-------------
Not yet written, but planned. Note that an SVD of a Hermitian matrix can easily be computed from the eigenvalue decomposition.

General SVD
-----------
Not yet written, but planned.
