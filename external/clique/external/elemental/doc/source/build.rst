Build system
************
Elemental's build system relies on `CMake <http://www.cmake.org>`__ 
in order to manage a large number of configuration options in a 
platform-independent manner; it can be easily configured to build on Linux and 
Unix environments (including Darwin) as well as various versions of 
Microsoft Windows.

Elemental's main dependencies are

1. `CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>`__ (required)
2. `MPI <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface>`_ (required) 
3. `BLAS <http://netlib.org/blas>`__ and `LAPACK <http://netlib.org/lapack>`__ (required)
4. `PMRRR <http://code.google.com/p/pmrrr>`_ (required for eigensolvers)
5. `libFLAME <http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/>`_ (recommended for faster SVD's) 

Each of these dependencies is discussed in detail below.

Dependencies
============

CMake
-----
Elemental uses several new CMake modules, so it is important to ensure that 
version 2.8.5 or later is installed. Thankfully the 
`installation process <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/install.html>`_
is extremely straightforward: either download a platform-specific binary from
the `downloads page <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html>`_,
or instead grab the most recent stable tarball and have CMake bootstrap itself.
In the simplest case, the bootstrap process is as simple as running the 
following commands::

    ./bootstrap
    make
    make install

Note that recent versions of `Ubuntu <http://www.ubuntu.com/>`__ (e.g., version 12.04) have sufficiently up-to-date
versions of CMake, and so the following command is sufficient for installation::

    sudo apt-get install cmake

If you do install from source, there are two important issues to consider

1. By default, ``make install`` attempts a system-wide installation 
   (e.g., into ``/usr/bin``) and will likely require administrative privileges.
   A different installation folder may be specified with the ``--prefix`` 
   option to the ``bootstrap`` script, e.g.,::

    ./bootstrap --prefix=/home/your_username
    make
    make install

   Afterwards, it is a good idea to make sure that the environment variable 
   ``PATH`` includes the ``bin`` subdirectory of the installation folder, e.g.,
   ``/home/your_username/bin``.

2. Some highly optimizing compilers will not correctly build CMake, but the GNU
   compilers nearly always work. You can specify which compilers to use by
   setting the environment variables ``CC`` and ``CXX`` to the full paths to 
   your preferred C and C++ compilers before running the ``bootstrap`` script.

Basic usage
^^^^^^^^^^^
Though many configuration utilities, like 
`autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>`_, are designed such that
the user need only invoke ``./configure && make && make install`` from the
top-level source directory, CMake targets *out-of-source* builds, which is 
to say that the build process occurs away from the source code. The 
out-of-source build approach is ideal for projects that offer several 
different build modes, as each version of the project can be built in a 
separate folder.

A common approach is to create a folder named ``build`` in the top-level of 
the source directory and to invoke CMake from within it::

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..

The last line calls the command line version of CMake, ``cmake``,
and tells it that it should look in the parent directory for the configuration
instructions, which should be in a file named ``CMakeLists.txt``. Users that 
would prefer a graphical interface from the terminal (through ``curses``)
should instead use ``ccmake`` (on Unix platforms) or ``CMakeSetup`` 
(on Windows platforms). In addition, a GUI version is available through 
``cmake-gui``. 

Though running ``make clean`` will remove all files generated from running 
``make``, it will not remove configuration files. Thus, the best approach for
completely cleaning a build is to remove the entire build folder. On \*nix 
machines, this is most easily accomplished with::

    cd .. 
    rm -rf build

This is a better habit than simply running ``rm -rf *`` since, 
if accidentally run from the wrong directory, the former will most likely fail.

MPI
---
An implementation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) is required for 
building Elemental. The two most commonly used implementations are

1. `MPICH2 <http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/>`_
2. `OpenMPI <http://www.open-mpi.org/>`_

If your cluster uses `InfiniBand <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand>`_ as its interconnect, you may want to look into 
`MVAPICH2 <http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/overview/mvapich2/>`_.

Each of the respective websites contains installation instructions, but, on recent versions of `Ubuntu <http://www.ubuntu.com/>`__ (such as version 12.04), 
MPICH2 can be installed with ::

    sudo apt-get install libmpich2-dev

and OpenMPI can be installed with ::

    sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev

BLAS and LAPACK
---------------
The Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) and Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK) 
are both used heavily within Elemental. On most installations of `Ubuntu <http://www.ubuntu.com>`__, the following command should suffice for their installation::

    sudo apt-get install libatlas-dev liblapack-dev

The reference implementation of LAPACK can be found at

    http://www.netlib.org/lapack/

and the reference implementation of BLAS can be found at

    http://www.netlib.org/blas/

However, it is better to install an optimized version of these libraries,
especialy for the BLAS. The most commonly used open source versions are 
`ATLAS <http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/>`__ and `OpenBLAS <https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS>`__.

PMRRR
-----
PMRRR is a parallel implementation of the MRRR algorithm introduced by 
`Inderjit Dhillon <http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~inderjit/>`_ and 
`Beresford Parlett <http://math.berkeley.edu/~parlett/>`_ for computing 
:math:`k` eigenvectors of a tridiagonal matrix of size :math:`n` in 
:math:`\mathcal{O}(nk)` time. PMRRR was written by 
`Matthias Petschow <http://www.aices.rwth-aachen.de/people/petschow>`_ and 
`Paolo Bientinesi <http://www.aices.rwth-aachen.de/people/bientinesi>`_ and is 
available at:

    http://code.google.com/p/pmrrr

Elemental builds a copy of PMRRR by default whenever possible: if an up-to-date
non-MKL version of LAPACK is used, then PMRRR only requires a working MPI C 
compiler, otherwise, a Fortran 90 compiler is needed in order to build several
recent LAPACK functions. If these LAPACK routines cannot be made available, 
then PMRRR is not built and Elemental's eigensolvers are automatically disabled.

libFLAME
--------
`libFLAME` is an open source library made available as part of the FLAME 
project. Its stated objective is to

.. epigraph::
   ...transform the development of dense linear algebra libraries from an art 
   reserved for experts to a science that can be understood by novice and 
   expert alike.

Elemental's current implementation of parallel SVD is dependent upon a serial 
kernel for the bidiagonal SVD. A high-performance implementation of this 
kernel was recently introduced in 
"Restructuring the QR Algorithm for Performance", by Field G. van Zee, Robert 
A. van de Geijn, and Gregorio Quintana-Orti. It can be found at

    http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/pubs/RestructuredQRTOMS.pdf

Installation of `libFLAME` is fairly straightforward. It is recommended that 
you download the latest nightly snapshot from

    http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/snapshots/

and then installation should simply be a matter of running::

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Getting Elemental's source 
==========================
There are two basic approaches:

1. Download a tarball of the most recent version from 
   `http://code.google.com/p/elemental/downloads/list 
   <http://code.google.com/p/elemental/downloads/list>`_. A new version is 
   released roughly once a month, on average.

2. Install `Mercurial <http://mercurial.selenic.com>`_ and check out a copy of 
   the repository by running ::

    hg clone https://elemental.googlecode.com/hg elemental

Building Elemental
==================
On \*nix machines with `BLAS <http://www.netlib.org/blas/>`__, 
`LAPACK <http://www.netlib.org/lapack/>`__, and 
`MPI <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface>`__ installed in 
standard locations, building Elemental can be as simple as::

    cd elemental
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install

As with the installation of CMake, the default install location is 
system-wide, e.g., ``/usr/local``. The installation directory can be changed
at any time by running::

    cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/desired/install/path ..
    make install


Though the above instructions will work on many systems, it is common to need
to manually specify several build options, especially when multiple versions of
libraries or several different compilers are available on your system. For 
instance, any C++, C, or Fortran compiler can respectively be set with the 
``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER``, ``CMAKE_C_COMPILER``, and ``CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER`` 
variables, e.g., ::

    cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++ \
          -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc   \
          -D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gfortran ..
    
It is also common to need to specify which libraries need to be linked in order
to provide serial BLAS and LAPACK routines (and, if SVD is important, libFLAME).
The ``MATH_LIBS`` variable was introduced for this purpose and an example 
usage for configuring with BLAS and LAPACK libraries in ``/usr/lib`` would be ::

    cmake -D MATH_LIBS="-L/usr/lib -llapack -lblas -lm" ..

It is important to ensure that if library A depends upon library B, A should 
be specified to the left of B; in this case, LAPACK depends upon BLAS, so 
``-llapack`` is specified to the left of ``-lblas``.

If `libFLAME <http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/>`__ is 
available at ``/path/to/libflame.a``, then the above link line should be changed
to ::

    cmake -D MATH_LIBS="/path/to/libflame.a;-L/usr/lib -llapack -lblas -lm" ..

Elemental's performance in Singular Value Decompositions (SVD's) is 
greatly improved on many architectures when libFLAME is linked.

Build Modes
-----------
Elemental currently has four different build modes:

* **PureDebug** - An MPI-only build that maintains a call stack and provides 
  more error checking.
* **PureRelease** - An optimized MPI-only build suitable for production use.
* **HybridDebug** - An MPI+OpenMP build that maintains a call stack and provides
  more error checking.
* **HybridRelease** - An optimized MPI+OpenMP build suitable for production use.

The build mode can be specified with the ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` option, e.g., 
``-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=PureDebug``. If this option is not specified, Elemental
defaults to the **PureRelease** build mode.

Testing the installation
========================
Once the library has been built, it is a good idea to verify that it is 
functioning properly. The following is a simple example that constructs of a 
distributed matrix, sets it to the identity matrix, then prints it:

   .. code-block:: cpp

      #include "elemental.hpp"
      using namespace elem;

      void Usage()
      {
          std::cout << "Identity <n>\n"
                    << "  n: size of identity matrix to build\n"
                    << std::endl;
      }

      int
      main( int argc, char* argv[] )
      {
          Initialize( argc, argv );
          mpi::Comm comm = mpi::COMM_WORLD;
          const int commRank = mpi::CommRank( comm );
          const int commSize = mpi::CommSize( comm );

          if( argc < 2 )
          {
              if( commRank == 0 )
                  Usage();
              Finalize();
              return 0;
          }
          const int n = atoi( argv[1] );

          DistMatrix<double> I( n, n );
          MakeIdentity( I );
          I.Print("Identity");

          Finalize();
          return 0;
      }

As you can see, the only required header is ``elemental.hpp``, which must be
in the include path when compiling this simple driver, say ``Identity.cpp``. 
If Elemental was installed in ``/usr/local``, then 
``/usr/local/conf/elemvariables`` can be used to build a simple Makefile::

    include /usr/local/conf/elemvariables

    Identity: Identity.cpp
        ${CXX} ${ELEM_COMPILE_FLAGS} $< -o $@ ${ELEM_LINK_FLAGS} ${ELEM_LIBS}

As long as ``Identity.cpp`` and this ``Makefile`` are in the current directory,
simply typing ``make`` should build the driver. A slightly modified 
version of the above driver is available in 
``examples/special_matrices/Identity.cpp``.

The executable can then typically be run with a single process using ::

    ./Identity 8

and the output should be ::

    Creating a matrix distributed over 1 process.

    Identity
    1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
    0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 
    0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 

The driver can be run with several processes using the MPI launcher provided
by your MPI implementation; a typical way to run the ``Identity`` driver on 
eight processes would be::

    mpirun -np 8 ./Identity 8

Only the first line of the output should change with respect to when run on 
a single process.

Elemental as a subproject
=========================
Building your project, say ``Foo``, with Elemental as a dependency is reasonably
straightforward: simply put an entire copy of the Elemental source tree in a 
subdirectory of your main project folder, say ``external/elemental``, and uncomment
out the bottom section of Elemental's ``CMakeLists.txt``, i.e., change ::

    ################################################################################

    set(USE_BYTE_ALLGATHERS ${USE_BYTE_ALLGATHERS} PARENT_SCOPE)
           
Afterwards, create a ``CMakeLists.txt`` in your main project folder that builds 
off of the following snippet::

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.5) 
    project(Foo)

    add_subdirectory(external/elemental)
    include_directories("${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/external/elemental/include")
    include_directories(${MPI_CXX_INCLUDE_PATH})

    # Build your project here
    # e.g., 
    #   add_library(foo STATIC ${FOO_SRC})
    #   target_link_libraries(foo elemental)
