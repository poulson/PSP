Please look in the doc/ folder for the current documentation. While the 
documentation is far from complete, it does contain up-to-date build 
instructions and a general outline of the provided functionality.

While you will need a copy of Sphinx [http://sphinx.pocoo.org/] in order to 
build the documentation, the ".rst" files in the doc/source directory are 
human readable. On *nix machines, Sphinx can often be installed with the command

    easy_install -U Sphinx

Please go to http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ for more details.
