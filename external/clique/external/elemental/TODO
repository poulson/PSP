Functionality
=============
- Pivoted QR decompositions 
- Nonsymmetric eigensolver
- Nonsymmetric generalized eigensolver
- More explicit expansions of packed Householder reflectors
- More TwoSidedTrmm/TwoSidedTrsm routines
- Add means of detaching and reattaching the 'viewing' processes for a 
  DistMatrix so that collective routines like 'Get' can still be called

==========
- Make namespacing of internal functions consistent
- Standardize on impl/decl pairs
