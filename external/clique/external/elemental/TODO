Functionality
=============
- Clean up pivoted LU and pivot applications (especially in sequential cases)
- Pivoted QR and LQ decompositions 
- Lower version of reduction to bidiagonal form
- Compressed SVD and pseudoinverse solves which avoid unnecessary 
  backtransformations
- Implement sequential versions of Trrk/Trr2k (and other routines)
- Add wrappers for more LAPACK eigensolvers
- More explicit expansions of packed Householder reflectors
- More TwoSidedTrmm/TwoSidedTrsm routines
- Nonsymmetric eigensolver
- Nonsymmetric generalized eigensolver
- Finish implementing complex trigonometric functions
- Add means of detaching and reattaching the 'viewing' processes for a 
  DistMatrix so that collective routines like 'Get' can still be called

Maintenance
===========
- Speeding up the build process (by switching away from monolithic headers)
- Consistent handling of unblocked routines
- Make namespacing of internal functions consistent
- Standardize on impl/decl pairs
