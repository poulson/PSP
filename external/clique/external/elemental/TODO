Relatively trivial but important 
================================
- Unit tests for unaligned DistMatrix redistributions and summations
- QR/LQ solves for AX=B
- Finish adding packed reflector application routines for horizontal storage
- Complete parallel Level2 BLAS (i.e., Trmv)

Relatively trivial but not important
====================================
- Add local versions of more blas/lapack-level routines
- Finish adding dot product gemm algorithms for NT, TN, and TT options

Substantial effort and important
================================
- SVD

Substantial effort but not terribly important 
=============================================
- Finish adding vector versions of all DistMatrix communications.
- Finish adding redistributions to and from [MD,* ]/[* ,MD]
