Jack,
 
Yes you can as long as you make it clear that Metis/ParMetis does not inherit 
the license terms under which you make your code available.

Karypis et al.,
 
I am a PhD student that is about to begin development of an open source library for the fast parallel solution of the 3d Helmholtz equation. It will make use of MUMPS for the sparse direct solver and PARMETIS is highly recommended for the nested dissection. I recognize that METIS and PARMETIS are not distributed under open source licenses, but I would like to distribute PARMETIS with my application in order to simplify the build process. May I have permission to do so?
 
Best Regards,
Jack Poulson
