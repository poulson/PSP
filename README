This project is only just getting started, so please be patient. We are 
targeting a working version sometime in March.

On Shark, I am currently targeting the build process looking like:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=`which mpicxx` -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=`which gcc` \
          -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=`which gfortran` \
          -DINTEL_ROOT=/opt/intel/Compiler/11.1/072 ..
    make

All C++ code requires an MPI compiler (our code) and all C and Fortran code 
expects a serial compiler (i.e., MUMPS and ParMetis). This is somewhat kludgy, 
but the next major release of CMake should support multi-language MPI 
configurations so that we could avoid our ad-hoc mixture of MPI and non-MPI 
compilers.
