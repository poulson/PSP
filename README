The scientific dependencies (MUMPS,ScaLAPACK,BLACS,Metis,ParMetis) have been 
moved to PETSc since PETSc's GMRES is going to be used anyway. Since ParMetis 
is not used by typical PETSc installations from MUMPS, petsc-dev should be used.
You can find instructions for obtaining a copy of petsc-dev here:
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-2/developers/index.html

The following configure flags were used in Ubuntu with BLAS/LAPACK in /usr/lib:

    ./config/configure.py --with-clanguage=cxx --download-mumps=1 \
      --download-scotch=1 --with-scotch=1 \
      --download-parmetis=1 --with-parmetis=1 \
      --download-scalapack=1 --download-blacs=1 \
      --with-blas-lapack-lib="[-L/usr/lib,-llapack,-lblas,-lgfortran]" \
      --with-cxx=mpicxx --with-cc=mpicc --with-fc=mpif90 --with-x=0 \
      --with-scalar-type=complex --with-c2html=0

The above flags are far from optimal since it builds the debug version of PETSc.

PSP can then be built using:

    cd psp 
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=`which mpicxx` -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=`which mpicc` \
      -DPETSC_DIR=/path/to/top/of/petsc-dev \
      -DPETSC_ARCH_DIR=/path/to/top/of/petsc-dev/arch ..
    make

If something other than the reference BLAS/LAPACK libs are desired for PSP, 
you should add them into the CMake command using a semi-colon delimited list
of the form:
    -DMATH_LIBS="/path/to/first/lib.a;/path/to/second/lib.a"
