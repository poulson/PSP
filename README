This project is only just getting started, so please be patient. We are 
targeting a working version sometime in March.

The scientific dependencies (MUMPS,ScaLAPACK,BLACS,Metis,ParMetis) have been 
moved to PETSc since PETSc's GMRES is going to be used anyway. Since ParMetis 
is not used by typical PETSc installations from MUMPS, petsc-dev should be used.
You can find instructions for obtaining a copy of petsc-dev here:
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-2/developers/index.html

The following configure flags are being used on BG/P:

    ./config/configure.py --with-clanguage=cxx --download-mumps=1 --download-parmetis=1 --with-parmetis=1 --download-scalapack=1 --download-blacs=1 --with-lapack-lib=/soft/apps/LAPACK/liblapack_bgp.a --with-blas-lib=/soft/apps/ESSL-4.3.1-1/lib/libesslbg.a --with-cxx=`which mpixlcxx_r` --with-cc=`which mpixlc_r` --with-fc='mpixlf77_r -qnosave' --with-x=0

PSP can then be built on BG/P using:
    cd psp 
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchains/BGP-xl_dec2010-essl_4.3.1-1.cmake -DPETSC_DIR=/path/to/top/of/petsc-dev -DPETSC_DIR=/path/to/top/of/petsc-dev/then/arch ..
    make
