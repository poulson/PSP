Note: The library is being rewritten using H-matrices for the padded panel 
      inverses, so it is will not be functional for a while.

PSP can usually be configured and built using:

    cd psp 
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=`which mpicxx` 
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=`which mpicc` ..
    make

If something other than the reference BLAS/LAPACK libs are desired for PSP, 
you should add them into the CMake command using a semi-colon delimited list
of the form:
    -DMATH_LIBS="/path/to/first/lib.a;/path/to/second/lib.a"
