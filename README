This project is only just getting started, so please be patient. We are 
targeting a working version sometime in March.

On Shark, I am currently targeting the build process looking like:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=`which mpicxx` \
          -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=`which mpicc` \
          -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=`which mpif90` \
          -DINTEL_ROOT=/opt/intel/Compiler/11.1/072 ..
    make

Each of the specified compilers should support MPI.
