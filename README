This project is only just getting started, so please be patient. We are 
targeting a working version sometime in March.

I will soon create a toolchain file for BG/P since Shark is not functioning 
properly.

#On Shark, I am currently targeting the build process looking like:
#    mkdir build
#    cd build
#    cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/mpicxx.mpich \
#          -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/mpicc.mpich \
#          -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=/usr/bin/mpif90.mpich \
#          -DFortran_FLAGS="-O3 -I/usr/lib/mpich/include" \
#          -DINTEL_ROOT=/opt/intel/Compiler/11.1/072 ..
#    make
#
#
#As of now, the resulting executables should be run with /usr/bin/mpirun.mpich,
#e.g., to run bin/PanelTest on a 100 x 100 x 10 grid with 6 processes,
#    cd build/bin
#    mpirun.mpich -np 6 ./PanelTest 100 100 10
