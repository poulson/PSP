This project is only just getting started, so please be patient. We are 
targeting a working version sometime in March.

The scientific dependencies (MUMPS,ScaLAPACK,BLACS,Metis,ParMetis) have been 
moved to PETSc since PETSc's GMRES is going to be used anyway. Since ParMetis 
is not used by typical PETSc installations from MUMPS, petsc-dev should be used.
You can find instructions for obtaining a copy of petsc-dev here:
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-2/developers/index.html

The following configure flags were used on BG/P:
    
    ./config/configure.py --with-clanguage=cxx --download-mumps=1 \
      --download-parmetis=1 --download-superlu_dist=1 --with-parmetis=1 \
      --download-scalapack=1 --download-blacs=1 \
      --with-blas-lapack-lib=[/soft/apps/LAPACK/liblapack_bgp.a,/soft/apps/ESSL-4.3.1-1/lib/libesslbg.a,/soft/apps/ibmcmp-dec2010/xlf/bg/11.1/bglib/libxlfmath.a,/soft/apps/ibmcmp-dec2010/xlf/bg/11.1/bglib/libxlf90_r.a,/soft/apps/ibmcmp-dec2010/xlsmp/bg/1.7/bglib/libxlomp_ser.a] \
      --with-cxx=mpixlcxx_r --with-cc=mpixlc_r --with-fc='mpixlf77_r -qnosave' \
      --with-x=0 --with-batch=1 --known-mpi-shared-libraries=0 \
      --with-scalar-type=complex 

The above flags are far from optimal since it builds the debug version of PETSc.

PSP can then be built using:

    cd psp 
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=`which mpicxx` -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=`which mpicc` \
      -DPETSC_DIR=/path/to/top/of/petsc-dev \
      -DPETSC_ARCH_DIR=/path/to/top/of/petsc-dev/arch ..
    make

If something other than the reference BLAS/LAPACK libs are desired for PSP, 
you should add them into the CMake command using a semi-colon delimited list
of the form:
    -DMATH_LIBS="/path/to/first/lib.a;/path/to/second/lib.a"
