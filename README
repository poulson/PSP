This project is only just getting started, so please be patient. We are 
targeting a working version sometime in March.

On Shark, I am currently targeting the build process looking like:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/mpicxx.mpich \
          -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/mpicc.mpich \
          -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=/usr/bin/mpif90.mpich \
          -DFortran_FLAGS="-O3 -I/usr/lib/mpich/include" \
          -DINTEL_ROOT=/opt/intel/Compiler/11.1/072 ..
    make

Each of the specified compilers should support MPI.

As of now, the resulting executables should be run with /usr/bin/mpirun.mpich,
e.g., to run bin/PanelTest on a 100 x 100 x 10 grid with 6 processes,
    cd build/bin
    mpirun.mpich -np 6 ./PanelTest 100 100 10
This currently requires entering your password p-1 times when p MPI processes 
are launched. The need for entering in your password can be fixed by properly
installing ssh keys or setting up mpd.
